# Essential Readings in the Digital Humanities - Space and Mapping

This repository contains sample geospatial data for the Washington University in St. Louis graduate seminar **Humanities by the Numbers: Essential Readings in the Digital Humanities**.

Each folder contains a nodes csv and an edges csv that can be imported into Gephi and used for **Lab Report #2**. Each folder also includes background information about the original source of the data, the methodologies used to compile it, and the context/significance of the social network.

The sample network datasets include: [modernist authors who published together in journals](/sample_datasets/modernist_journals_project/); [characters in the Marvel Universe](/sample_datasets/marvel/); [seventeenth-century Quakers](/sample_datasets/quakers/); [books about U.S. politics that were co-purchased around the 2004 presidential election](/sample_datasets/political_books/); and [people in TrumpWorld](/sample_datasets/trump/). 

If you're not sure how to download the csvs, see this [quick tutorial](/download_tutorial/).
