# Essential Readings in the Digital Humanities - Space and Mapping

This repository contains sample geospatial data for the Washington University in St. Louis graduate seminar **Humanities by the Numbers: Essential Readings in the Digital Humanities**, which we will use to explore mapping tools such as Google Maps, Palladio, and QGIS. The two datasets included here consist of: information about [Nobel Prize Winners from 1901-2017](/sample-datasets/nobel-prize-winners/); [city and demographics information about St. Louis taken from the 2010 census](/sample-datasets/st-louis-2010-census/).

Download the long-term support version of QGIS for [Windows here](http://qgis.org/downloads/QGIS-OSGeo4W-3.0.1-1-Setup-x86_64.exe) or for [Mac OS X here](http://www.kyngchaos.com/files/software/qgis/QGIS-2.18.15-4.dmg).
