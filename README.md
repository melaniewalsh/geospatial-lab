# Essential Readings in the Digital Humanities - Space and Mapping

This repository contains sample geospatial data for the Washington University in St. Louis graduate seminar **Humanities by the Numbers: Essential Readings in the Digital Humanities**. We will use this data to explore mapping tools such as Google Maps, Palladio, and QGIS.


The datasets contain information about [Nobel Prize Winners from 1901-2017](/sample-datasets/nobel-prize-winners/) and [the city of St. Louis from the 2010 census](/sample-datasets/st-louis-2010-census/).
