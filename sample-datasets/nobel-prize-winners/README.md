This folder contains geospatial data for the birth and death places of Nobel Prize Winners from 1901-2017, originally downloaded and modified from [the European Data Portal](https://www.europeandataportal.eu/data/en/dataset/nobel-prizes) and retrieved from [the official Nobel Prize API](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_organizations/nobelmedia/nobelprize_org/developer/). The birth and death places are included as both text ("Berlin," "Germany," "Berlin, Germany") as well as longitude and latitude coordinates (including a specially formatted coordinates column for use with [Palladio](http://hdlab.stanford.edu/palladio/)). In some cases, a Nobel Laureate's birth or death place has been renamed since the time of their birth or death. For the purposes of mapping with modern coordinates systems, a separate column has been created to represent birth and death place under the location's currently accepted name.

The dataset also includes information about the Nobel Laureate's name, birth and death date, gender, year that they won the Nobel Prize, category in which they won the Nobel Prize, and a brief description of why they were given the prize by the Academy.
